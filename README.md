![Terraform Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/tf-%3E%3D0.14.0-blue.svg)

This repo contains modules to perform load balancing on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/).

## Cloud Load Balancer Architecture

![Cloud Load Balancer Architecture](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/_docs/cloud-load-balancer.png "Cloud Load Balancer Architecture")

## Features

- Load balance HTTP and HTTPS traffic across multiple backend instances, across multiple regions with HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
- Load balance internal TCP/UDP traffic with Internal Load Balancing
- Load balance external TCP/UDP traffic with Network Load Balancing

## Learn

This repo is a part of [the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you’ve never used the Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read [How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/)!

### Repo organisation

This repo has the following folder structure:

- [root](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/tree/master): The root folder contains an example of how to deploy a HTTP Load Balancer with multiple backends. See [http-multi-backend example documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/examples/http-multi-backend) for the documentation.

- [modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules): This folder contains the main implementation code for this Module.

  The primary modules are:

  - [http-load-balancer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules/http-load-balancer) is used to create an [HTTP(S) External Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/).
  - [internal-load-balancer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules/internal-load-balancer) is used to create an [Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/).
  - [network-load-balancer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules/network-load-balancer) is used to create an [External TCP/UDP Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/network/).

- [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the submodules.

- [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and examples.

## Deploy
